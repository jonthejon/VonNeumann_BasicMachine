# VonNeumann_BasicMachine
This project is designed to mimic the creation of a Von Neumann machine.

The book "Code: The Hidden Language of Computers", from Charles Petzold, is used as guideline for implementing a working Von Newumann Machine.

Although the behavior of a logic gate can easily be accomplished using a couple of IF statements, the goal of this project is not to develop the most efficient code, but rather to mimic the physical development of a computer starting from the very basic components and wiring them out one by one.

In this project, following the cited book, we are using Telegraph Relays as our most basic component and working up from it. But the project is coded towards interfaces, therefore, allowing a future shift in the use of transistor.
