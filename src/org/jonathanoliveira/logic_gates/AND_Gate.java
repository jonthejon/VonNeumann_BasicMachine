/*
* All gates are made of components, no matter how many.
* An AND gate must be able to receive a certain number of inputs and come out with the proper output.
*
* So, in essence, the behavior of an AND gate is the following:
* if (ALL INPUTS): true, then OUTPUT ==  true
* if (AT LEAST 1 INPUT): false, then OUTPUT ==  false
*
*     AND | 0 | 1 |
*    --------------
*      0  | 0 | 0 |
*    --------------
*      1  | 0 | 1 |
